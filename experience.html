<li><strong>A Barista on cafe</strong><br />
ꕥ I have worked as a barista at Nasken Coffee located at Lmebah Sireh, Kota Bharu for 7 month. Thus, I have learnt many things 
like make coffee,beverages, learnt how to opening and closing the cafe. As a result, I really enjoyed working at this cafe as 
I really like this kind of works. Despite of my studies, I manage to work while study as I need to divide time equally 
and smoothly. Since I have to pursue my studies at college, I have to quit this job, and planning to continue it after graduate.
