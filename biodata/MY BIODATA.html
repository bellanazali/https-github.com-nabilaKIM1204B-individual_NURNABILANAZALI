<p>Hello everyone! As you see, all of this are my biography briefly. Let me introduce myself, my name is Nabila Nazali, and Im recommended to everyone to call me Bella hehe >< this is because it is shorter and easier to call out. However, i really like both of them :P ! 
Currently, my age is 20. Yes Im on my twenty, a lot of things happened on my 20, otherwise, Iam very grateful as I can explore and experiencing something that i never feel, such as in my last sem, I have to be back on my college, as I never feel what it was like living in college, 
this is giving me a new enviroment and experience. Thus, I have met many friends including my classmates, lecturers and more. I was born at Gombak, Kuala Lumpur, but presently, I am live in Kelantan as I transferred here when I was 10years old. It has been 12years since I transferred.
Nevertheless, living here is great as Kelantan always serve a good food! It was called food heaven for a reason! Moving on, I really love drawing, as a result, Im not that good in writing, but! Im very good at painting, I love to create new and different art by using the painters only.
As my father is a painter, he has taught me a lot about painting. Hence, Im very interested in painting! Beside of that, I do love dancing, as actually, I love indoor exersice, since then, I really enjoyed dancing as  part of my exersice. 
So, thats all about me !
Ops! its still not over yet :P ! 
Lets visit another page to get know a better me!
